# Dart + Flutter Mastery Roadmap (2026)

This repository documents my journey to becoming a **Pro Flutter Engineer**
with deep expertise in **Dart internals, Flutter framework, performance,
architecture, and native integration**.

## Goals
- Master Dart VM, concurrency, memory & FFI
- Understand Flutter from Widget → Engine
- Build production-grade, scalable applications
- Reach staff / principal Flutter engineer level

## Structure
- `dart-advanced/` → Language, VM, isolates, FFI
- `flutter-advanced/` → Framework, performance, engine
- `projects/` → Portfolio-grade applications

## Learning Philosophy
- No shallow tutorials
- Internals before abstractions
- Measure performance, don’t guess
- Architecture over hacks
